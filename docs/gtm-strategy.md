# CoWork OS — Product Positioning & GTM Strategy

> Status: Active draft, aligned to current product docs.

## Category Definition

CoWork OS is a **security-hardened, local-first AI operating system**.

- OpenClaw is best positioned as an agent experimentation toolkit.
- CoWork OS is positioned as the production runtime for running agents safely across real workflows.

## Primary Positioning Statement

CoWork OS is the production alternative to OpenClaw for users who need:

- Guardrails and approval workflows by default
- Local-first data ownership (BYOK, no telemetry)
- A multi-channel operating layer (14 messaging channels)
- A desktop + headless runtime that can be governed in daily operations

Short form:

> OpenClaw helps you build agents. CoWork OS helps you run them safely.

## Core Buyer Profiles

1. Technical founders running customer-facing or ops-heavy automation.
2. Security-conscious builders who need local control over data and keys.
3. Team leads who want agent output in existing messaging channels with approval gates.
4. Power users who want agent autonomy without cloud lock-in.

## Differentiation Pillars

### 1) Playground to Production

CoWork OS prioritizes execution discipline over experimentation novelty:
approval workflows, guardrail budgets, policy enforcement, and sandboxed execution.

### 2) Security-First by Design

CoWork OS ships with core controls required for practical use:
dangerous command blocking, configurable limits, encrypted local settings, and context-aware tool controls.

### 3) Multi-Channel AI Operating Layer

CoWork OS is not just a local runner. It is a messaging-native runtime across 14 channels with shared security modes and governance.

### 4) Local-First + BYOK

Users keep control of data and provider keys with optional offline model execution via Ollama.

## Proof Points to Reuse in Messaging

- 30+ LLM providers
- 14 messaging channels
- 100+ built-in skills
- 3200+ tests
- ZeroLeaks report published in-repo

## Narrative Guardrails

Do:

- Contrast category focus (toolkit vs operating system).
- Emphasize production readiness and security controls.
- Stay factual and neutral in competitor references.

Do not:

- Frame as "more features than OpenClaw" only.
- Rely on speculative competitor claims.
- Use adversarial language.
