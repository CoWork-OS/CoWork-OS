(A $0.10 beat with $0.02 raise suggests management caution)\n- New assumptions vs. prior: What changed in the macro/micro outlook?\n- Read-through for the rest of the sector\n\n## Earnings Call Takeaways\n\nSummarize the 5 most important themes from the earnings call:\n1. **Key quote from management** and its significance\n2. **Most important analyst question** and management's response\n3. **New strategic initiatives** announced or updated\n4. **Competitive dynamics** commentary\n5. **Capital allocation priorities** (buybacks, M&A appetite, dividend changes)\n\n## Estimate Revision Implications\n\nBased on the results and guidance:\n- How should current-year estimates change?\n- How should next-year estimates change?\n- Does this warrant a price target adjustment? Direction and approximate magnitude?\n- Does this change the investment thesis? Reiterate, upgrade, or downgrade?\n\n## Sector Read-Through\nWhat do these results imply for peers in the same sector? Identify 2-3 companies that may benefit or suffer from the trends revealed.",
