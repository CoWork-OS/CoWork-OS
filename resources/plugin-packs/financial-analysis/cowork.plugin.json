Apply industry-specific growth drivers and competitive dynamics to justify forward assumptions.\n\n## Step 2: Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)\n\nCalculate WACC using the following components:\n\n**WACC = (E/V) x Re + (D/V) x Rd x (1 - Tc)**\n\nWhere:\n- **Re (Cost of Equity)** = Rf + Beta x (Rm - Rf) + Size Premium + Company-Specific Risk Premium\n  - Rf: Current 10-year Treasury yield\n  - Beta: Levered beta from comparable companies or regression analysis\n  - Equity Risk Premium: Damodaran or Duff & Phelps estimate (typically 4.5-6.5%)\n  - Size premium: Apply Ibbotson/Kroll size premium if applicable\n- **Rd (Cost of Debt)** = Yield on existing debt or synthetic rating approach\n- **E/V and D/V**: Target capital structure based on market values\n- **Tc**: Marginal corporate tax rate\n\nProvide the WACC calculation with all intermediate steps shown.\n\n## Step 3: Terminal Value\n\nCalculate terminal value using both methods and cross-check:\n\n**Gordon Growth Model:**\nTV = FCF(n+1) / (WACC - g)\n- Terminal growth rate (g): Typically 2-3%, should not exceed long-term GDP growth\n- FCF(n+1): Normalized free cash flow in the first year beyond the projection\n\n**Exit Multiple Method:**\nTV = EBITDA(n) x Exit Multiple\n- Exit multiple derived from current trading comps and historical M&A multiples\n- Apply a discount or premium based on company positioning\n\nTerminal value typically represents 60-80% of total enterprise value. Flag if outside this range.\n\n## Step 4: Sensitivity Analysis\n\nBuild a two-way sensitivity table varying:\n- WACC (+-1% in 0.5% increments) vs. Terminal Growth Rate (+-1% in 0.5% increments)\n- Revenue Growth vs. EBITDA Margin\n- Exit Multiple vs. WACC\n\nPresent results as implied share price (or enterprise value) at each intersection.\n\n## Step 5: Valuation Summary\n\nPresent:\n- Enterprise Value (sum of discounted FCFs + discounted terminal value)\n- Less: Net Debt (total debt - cash and equivalents)\n- Less: Minority interests, preferred equity\n- Plus: Equity investments, associates\n- **Equity Value**\n- **Implied Share Price** = Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding\n- Upside/downside to current market price\n- Football field chart showing range across scenarios\n\n## Output Format\nProvide all calculations in clearly labeled tables. Show your work at every step. Include base, bull, and bear case scenarios with probability-weighted expected value.",
