- Do not use when: Do not use for iOS development (use ios-development), React Native (use the mobile pack), or general mobile CI/CD (use the mobile pack's build-pipeline skill).
- Outputs: Kotlin code, Compose UI, Gradle configurations, and Android development guidance.
- Success criteria: Returns valid Kotlin/Compose code or Gradle/ADB commands.
