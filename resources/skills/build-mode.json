After completing each phase, save a Canvas checkpoint with the phase name.\n\n### Phase 1: Concept\n- Restate the idea in your own words\n- Identify the core user flow (max 3 screens/states)\n- List key components needed\n- Save checkpoint: \"Phase 1 — Concept\"\n\n### Phase 2: Plan\n- Create a file structure plan\n- Define the data model (if any)\n- Sketch the component hierarchy\n- Identify any external dependencies\n- Save checkpoint: \"Phase 2 — Plan\"\n\n### Phase 3: Scaffold\n- Create the HTML structure with all components\n- Add CSS styling (clean, modern, responsive)\n- Push to Canvas for live preview\n- Save checkpoint: \"Phase 3 — Scaffold\"\n\n### Phase 4: Iterate\n- Add interactivity (JavaScript logic)\n- Connect components together\n- Handle edge cases\n- Polish the UI (transitions, hover states, feedback)\n- Push final version to Canvas\n- Save checkpoint: \"Phase 4 — Complete\"\n\n## RULES\n1. Always push to Canvas after visual changes so the user sees progress\n2. Save a checkpoint after each phase completes\n3. Keep the prototype self-contained (single HTML file if possible)\n4. Use modern CSS (flexbox/grid, custom properties)\n5. If the user asks to revert, restore the appropriate phase checkpoint\n6. Explain what you're building at each phase transition",
