# Discord

## Purpose

Use when you need to control Discord from CoWork-OSS via the discord tool: send messages, react, post or upload stickers, upload emojis, run polls, manage threads/pins/search, create/edit/delete channels and categories, fetch permissions or member/role/channel info, or handle moderation actions in Discord DMs or channels.

## Routing

- Do not use when: Do not use when the request is asking for planning documents, high-level strategy, or non-executable discussion; use the relevant planning or design workflow instead.
- Outputs: Outcome from Discord: task-specific result plus concrete action notes.
- Success criteria: Returns concrete actions and decisions matching the requested task, with no fabricated tool-side behavior.
