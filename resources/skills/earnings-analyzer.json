  "prompt": "# Earnings Analysis Request\n\n**Company:** {{company}}\n**Analysis Type:** {{analysisType}}\n**Question:** {{question}}\n\n**Additional Context (if provided):**\n- Quarter: {{quarter}}\n- Earnings Data: {{earningsData}}\n\nUsing the earnings analysis framework below, perform a comprehensive review of this company's earnings. If specific earnings data is provided, incorporate it. Otherwise, use the framework to structure your analysis based on available information.\n\n---\n\n# Earnings Analysis Reference\n\n## EPS Analysis Framework\n\n### Beat/Miss Classification\n\n| Category | Definition | Typical Market Reaction |\n|----------|-----------|------------------------|\n| Blowout Beat | EPS > consensus by > 10% | +3 to +10% (sustained) |\n| Solid Beat | EPS > consensus by 3-10% | +1 to +5% |\n| Inline Beat | EPS > consensus by 0-3% | +/- 1% |\n| Inline Miss | EPS < consensus by 0-3% | -1 to -3% |\n| Clear Miss | EPS < consensus by 3-10% | -3 to -8% |\n| Significant Miss | EPS < consensus by > 10% | -5 to -15%+ |\n\n**Important:** Market reaction depends heavily on guidance, not just the beat/miss. A company can beat EPS but drop on lowered guidance.\n\n### EPS Quality Assessment\n\n**Reported EPS (GAAP) vs Adjusted EPS (Non-GAAP):**\n- Calculate the spread: (Adjusted - GAAP) / |GAAP|\n- Spread > 20% warrants investigation of adjustment items\n- Common adjustments: stock-based compensation, restructuring, amortization of intangibles, one-time items\n\n**EPS Drivers Decomposition:**\n\nEPS = (Revenue x Net Margin) / Diluted Shares\n\nYear-over-year EPS change can be decomposed into:\n1. Revenue growth contribution\n2. Margin expansion/contraction contribution\n3. Share count change contribution (buybacks/dilution)\n\n### Revision Trend Analysis\n\n| Trend | Signal | Implication |\n|-------|--------|-------------|\n| Rising estimates (3+ months) | Positive momentum | Likely continued beats |\n| Falling estimates | Negative momentum | Risk of further cuts |\n| Stable estimates | Consensus confidence | Lower surprise probability |\n| Wide estimate range | High uncertainty | Potential for large surprise |\n\n**Revision ratio:** Upward revisions / (Upward + Downward) in last 90 days\n- > 0.7: Strong positive sentiment\n- 0.4-0.6: Neutral\n- < 0.3: Negative sentiment\n\n### Historical Surprise Pattern\n\n Track the last 8 quarters:\n| Quarter | EPS Est. | EPS Actual | Surprise % | Revenue Est. | Revenue Actual | Surprise % |\n|---------|----------|------------|-----------|-------------|----------------|-----------%|\n| Q1 | | | | | | |\n| Q2 | | | | | | |\n| ... | | | | | | |\n| Q8 | | | | | | |\n\n**Pattern analysis:**\n- Consistent beaters (6+/8): Management likely sandbagging guidance\n- Inconsistent (3-5/8): True uncertainty in business\n- Consistent missers (< 3/8): Structural problems or over-optimistic consensus\n\n## Revenue Deep-Dive\n\n### Revenue Decomposition\n\n**Organic vs Inorganic:**\n- Organic growth = Same-store/like-for-like growth\n- Inorganic growth = Acquisitions\n- Currency impact = FX translation effect\n- Total Growth = Organic + Inorganic +/- FX\n\n**Price vs Volume:**\n- Revenue Growth = Price Increase % + Volume Growth % + (Price x Volume interaction)\n- Price-driven growth is higher quality (margin accretive)\n- Volume-driven growth at constant prices shows market share gains\n\n**Segment Breakdown:**\n\n| Segment | Revenue | % of Total | YoY Growth | Margin | Commentary |\n|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|------------|\n| Segment A | | | | | |\n| Segment B | | | | | |\n| Segment C | | | | | |\n| **Total** | | 100% | | | |\n\n**Geographic Breakdown:**\n\n| Region | Revenue | YoY Growth | % of Total | FX Impact |\n|--------|---------|-----------|-----------|----------|\n| North America | | | | |\n| Europe | | | | |\n| Asia-Pacific | | | | |\n| Rest of World | | | | |\n\n### Revenue Quality Indicators\n\n| Indicator | Good Sign | Warning Sign |\n|-----------|-----------|-------------|\n| Recurring vs one-time | High recurring % (> 80%) | One-time > 20% |\n| Customer concentration | Top 10 < 30% | Single customer > 15% |\n| Backlog trend | Growing sequentially | Declining for 2+ quarters |\n| ASP trend | Stable or rising | Declining without volume offset |\n| Net retention | > 110% | < 100% |\n| Deferred revenue | Growing faster than revenue | Declining |\n\n## Margin Analysis\n\n### Margin Waterfall\n\n| Metric | Current Q | Prior Q | YoY Q | YoY Change (bps) | Commentary |\n|--------|-----------|---------|-------|------------------|------------|\n| Gross Margin | | | | | |\n| R&D % | | | | | |\n| S&M % | | | | | |\n| G&A % | | | | | |\n| Operating Margin | | | | | |\n| Net Margin | | | | | |\n| EBITDA Margin | | | | | |\n| FCF Margin | | | | | |\n\n### Margin Expansion Drivers\n\n| Driver | Impact | Sustainability |\n|--------|--------|---------------|\n| Revenue scale (operating leverage) | High | Durable if growth continues |\n| Price increases | Medium-High | Depends on competitive position |\n| Input cost reduction | Medium | Potentially cyclical |\n| Workforce optimization | Medium | One-time benefit |\n| Mix shift to higher-margin products | High | Durable |\n| SBC reduction | Low-Medium | Often cosmetic (Non-GAAP) |\n| Restructuring savings | Medium | One-time with transition costs |\n\n### Margin Benchmarks by Sector\n\n| Sector | Gross Margin | Op Margin | Net Margin |\n|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|\n| SaaS | 70-85% | 15-30% | 10-25% |\n| Semiconductors | 50-65% | 25-40% | 20-35% |\n| Consumer Tech | 35-45% | 15-25% | 10-20% |\n| Pharma | 65-80% | 25-35% | 15-25% |\n| Banks | N/A | 30-40% | 25-35% |\n| Retail | 25-40% | 4-10% | 2-7% |\n| Industrials | 25-35% | 10-18% | 6-12% |\n\n## Forward Guidance Assessment\n\n### Guidance Components\n\n| Component | What to Track | Signal |\n|-----------|--------------|--------|\n| Revenue guidance | Range midpoint vs consensus | Above = positive;
