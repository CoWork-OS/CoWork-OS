FUNDAMENTALS\n\n### Why Email Wins\n- ROI: $36 per $1 spent (3,600%). Newsletter-as-business: 122%. Social: 28%. Paid search: 25%.\n- 89% of marketers use email as primary lead gen channel. 51% of consumers prefer email from brands.\n- Email is owned media — no algorithm throttling, no platform risk.\n- Multi-channel subscribers drive 50% higher purchase rates and LTV vs single-channel.\n\n### The Email Stack (6 components)\n1. **ESP** — sending platform (Klaviyo, Mailchimp, etc.). See Section 12.\n2. **Authentication** — SPF, DKIM, DMARC. Non-negotiable since Feb 2024 Google/Yahoo rules.\n3. **List management** — quality > size. 5K engaged beats 50K messy.\n4. **Content & design** — 60%+ opens on mobile. Mobile-first is essential.\n5. **Automation** — flows generate 30x more RPR than campaigns. Set up flows before campaigns.\n6. **Analytics** — 21% of marketers don't measure ROI. Don't be one of them.\n\n### Key Metrics & Benchmarks\n\n| Metric | Good | Strong | Red Flag |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Click-through rate | 2-3% | 4%+ | Below 1% |\n| Click-to-open rate | 10-15% | 20%+ | Below 5% |\n| Unsubscribe rate | Under 0.2% | Under 0.1% | Above 0.5% |\n| Bounce rate | Under 2% | Under 1% | Above 3% |\n| Spam complaint rate | Under 0.1% | Under 0.05% | Above 0.3% |\n| List growth rate | 3-5%/month | 5%+/month | Negative |\n| Delivery rate | 95%+ | 98%+ | Below 85% |\n| Inbox placement | 85-94% | 94%+ | Below 70% |\n\n**Post-Apple MPP:** Open rates are directional only. Use click-based metrics as primary.\n\n### Tags vs Segments vs Lists\n- **Lists:** Use ONE master list. Multiple lists = duplicate subscribers, inconsistent data.\n- **Tags:** Labels on subscribers (facts). Applied manually or via automation.\n- **Segments:** Dynamic groups based on rules. Auto-update as conditions change.\n- Minimum segments: new (last 30 days), engaged (clicked last 60 days), customers vs non-customers, lapsed (90+ days).\n\n> Full chapter: https://emailmarketingskill.com/01-fundamentals/\n\n---\n\n## 2. LIST BUILDING\n\n### Organic Growth\n- **Lead magnets:** Templates/swipe files convert highest. Free template increased signups by 384%.\n- **Content upgrades:** 5-10x better opt-in vs generic sidebar forms.\n- **Signup forms:** Form > link (20-50% more opt-ins). \"Get my templates\" > \"Subscribe\" (33% lift).\n\n### Popups\n- Well-timed popups: 3-5% conversion. Top 10%: 9.28%.\n- Exit-intent: 4-7%. Two-step popups: 30-50% better than single-step.\n\n### Double vs Single Opt-in\n- Double opt-in recommended for most. Validates addresses, prevents bots/traps, GDPR-ready.\n- Compromise: single opt-in for purchasers, double for lead magnets/popups.\n\n### List Hygiene & Spam Traps\n- Lists decay 22-30% annually. Unengaged subscribers cost money AND hurt deliverability.\n- **Sunset flow:** Reduce frequency → re-engagement series (2-3 emails) → suppress non-responders.\n- **Spam traps:** Pristine (honeypots), recycled (abandoned addresses), typo (gnail.com), role-based (info@).\n- **Prevention:** Double opt-in, real-time validation at signup, regular list cleaning, engagement-based sending.\n\n> Full chapter: https://emailmarketingskill.com/02-building-your-list/\n\n---\n\n## 3. SEGMENTATION & PERSONALISATION\n\n### Personalisation Hierarchy (most to least impactful)\n1. **Behavioural:** Product recs from browse/purchase history. Highest impact.\n2. **Lifecycle:** Different content for new, active, VIP, at-risk, lapsed.\n3. **Dynamic content blocks:** Different images/products per segment in one template.\n4. **Send-time:** Per-subscriber optimal timing.\n5. **Location-based:** Weather, events, timezone, nearby stores.\n6. **Name/demographic:** Fine as addition, not meaningful alone.\n\n### RFM Quick Start\nSimple version: segment by recency of last purchase into 4 groups:\n1. Purchased last 30 days (active)\n2. 31-90 days ago (warm)\n3. 91-180 days ago (cooling)\n4. 180+ days ago (cold)\n\n### Engagement-Based Sending (highest-impact optimisation)\n- **Tier 1:** Clicked last 30 days → every campaign\n- **Tier 2:** Clicked last 60 days → 75% of sends\n- **Tier 3:** Clicked last 90 days → best content only (50%)\n- **Tier 4:** No engagement 90-180 days → re-engagement flow only\n- **Tier 5:** 180+ days → sunset flow\n- Results: 15-30% better open rates, 20-40% fewer complaints, revenue stays flat or increases.\n\n### Waterfall Segmentation (prevents \"three emails in one day\")\nPriority: Abandoned cart → Post-purchase → Browse abandonment → Win-back → Promotional.\n\n> Full chapter: https://emailmarketingskill.com/03-segmentation-and-personalisation/\n\n---\n\n## 4. AUTOMATION FLOWS (Revenue Engines)\n\n### Automations vs Campaigns\n\n| Metric | Automations | Campaigns |\n|---|---|---|\n| Revenue per recipient | 30x higher | Baseline |\n| Open rate | 40-55% | 15-25% |\n| Click rate | 5-10% | 2-3% |\n\n### Flow Priority Order (by revenue impact per setup hour)\n1. Welcome series → 2. Abandoned cart → 3. Browse abandonment → 4. Post-purchase → 5. Win-back → 6. Cross-sell/upsell → 7. VIP/loyalty → 8. Sunset → 9. Birthday → 10. Replenishment → 11. Back-in-stock → 12. Price drop\n\n### Welcome Series (4-6 emails, 1-2 weeks)\n- Open rate: 51-55%. Revenue: 320% more per email vs promotional.\n- **Email 1 (immediate):** Deliver promise + ask for reply + one segmentation question.\n- **Email 2 (Day 2):** Brand story.\n- **Email 3 (Day 4):** Social proof.\n- **Email 4 (Day 7):** Best content/product using segmentation data.\n- **Email 5 (Day 10):** Soft sell.\n- **Email 6 (Day 14):** Set expectations + preference centre link.\n\n### Abandoned Cart (3 emails)\n- 70% of carts abandoned. Recovery: 17.12% conversion. Top 10%: $3.07 RPR.\n- **Email 1 (1-4h):** Simple reminder. NO discount.\n- **Email 2 (24h):** Address objections. Reviews, shipping, guarantee.\n- **Email 3 (48h):** Small incentive if margins allow. First-time abandoners only.\n\n### Post-Purchase Sequence\nImmediately: Order confirmation → Day 2-3: Shipping → Day 7-10: Satisfaction check → Day 14: Review request → Day 21-30: Cross-sell → Day 25-30: Replenishment (consumables).\n\n### Win-Back (target 60-90 day inactive)\n1. \"We miss you\" → 2. Value offer → 3. Breakup email (highest reply rate) → 4. Confirmation + re-subscribe link.\n\n> Full chapter: https://emailmarketingskill.com/04-the-emails-that-make-money/\n\n---\n\n## 5. COPYWRITING\n\n### Subject Lines\n- 64% decide to open based on subject line. Under 25 chars = highest opens.\n- Personalisation: +14% opens. First-person CTA > second-person (25-35% lift).\n\n### Body Copy\n- Inverted pyramid: key message first. Short paragraphs. Write, then cut 30%.\n- 3:1 ratio: three value emails per one promotional.\n\n### Copywriting Frameworks\n- **AIDA:** Attention → Interest → Desire → Action. Best for promotional.\n- **PAS:** Problem → Agitate → Solution. Best for cold email, B2B.\n- **BAB:** Before → After → Bridge. Best for case studies.\n- **Soap Opera Sequence (Chaperon):** Multi-email narrative. 70%+ open rates deep in sequence.\n- **1-3-1 Newsletter:** One big story + three shorter items + one CTA.\n\n### CTAs\n- Buttons > text links (+27% CTR). Single CTA: +42% clicks vs multiple.\n- Place CTA above fold AND below main content (+35% total clicks).\n\n> Full chapter: https://emailmarketingskill.com/05-copywriting-that-converts/\n\n---\n\n## 6. DESIGN & TECHNICAL\n\n- 60%+ opens on mobile. Single-column layouts. Width: 600-640px. Touch targets: 44x44px.\n- Font: 14-16px body, 20-22px headlines. Images: under 200KB each, total under 800KB.\n- Dark mode (33%+): Transparent PNGs, off-white backgrounds, `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`.\n- Accessibility: 4.5:1 contrast, alt text, logical reading order.\n\n> Full chapter: https://emailmarketingskill.com/06-design-and-technical/\n\n---\n\n## 7. DELIVERABILITY\n\n### Authentication (all three required)\n- **SPF:** DNS TXT record listing authorised sending IPs. 10 DNS lookup limit. End with `-all`.\n- **DKIM:** 2048-bit RSA keys. Rotate annually. `d=` domain must align with From address.\n- **DMARC:** Implement in stages: `p=none` → `p=quarantine` → `p=reject`.\n- **BIMI:** Brand logo in inbox. Requires DMARC enforcement + VMC (~$1,500/year).\n- **Order:** SPF → DKIM → DMARC (p=none) → advance DMARC → BIMI.\n\n### Sender Reputation\n- Domain reputation > IP reputation for Gmail (120-day window).\n- Dedicated IP: only if sending 1M+/month. Below that, shared IPs are fine.\n\n### Sending Identity\n- Separate marketing from transactional: different subdomains. Worth it at 40K+/month.\n- From name: personal names get +3.81% opens. Always set monitored reply-to.\n\n### Deliverability Diagnosis (10-step framework)\n1. Identify symptom → 2. Check authentication → 3. Check blocklists → 4. Check reputation → 5. Analyse bounce logs → 6. Review sending patterns → 7. Check content → 8. Test and validate → 9. Remediate root cause → 10. Monitor recovery (2-4 weeks, Gmail up to 120 days).\n\n### Domain/IP Warming\nDays 1-3: 50-100 → Days 4-7: 200-500 → Week 2: 500-1K → Week 3: 1-5K → Week 4: 5-10K → Week 5+: Scale to full. Start with most engaged subscribers.\n\n> Full chapter: https://emailmarketingskill.com/07-deliverability/\n\n---\n\n## 8. TESTING & OPTIMISATION\n\n- **Highest priority tests:** Sender name (compounds), CTA format, template structure.\n- Only 1 in 7 tests produces significant winner. Use 95% confidence calculator.\n- Prioritise testing automated flows over campaigns (flow improvements compound indefinitely).\n- STO: 5-15% improvement in open rates. Per-subscriber timing.\n\n> Full chapter: https://emailmarketingskill.com/08-testing-and-optimisation/\n\n---\n\n## 9.
