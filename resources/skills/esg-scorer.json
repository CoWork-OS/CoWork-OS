Strategy:**\n- Climate risks and opportunities over short, medium, long term\n- Impact on business, strategy, and financial planning\n- Scenario analysis (well below 2C, 2C, 4C pathways)\n\n**3. Risk Management:**\n- Processes for identifying and assessing climate risks\n- Integration into overall risk management\n- Transition risk vs physical risk assessment\n\n**4. Metrics & Targets:**\n- Scope 1, 2, 3 emissions\n- Climate-related targets and progress\n- Internal carbon pricing\n\n### Climate Risk Categories\n\n| Risk Type | Examples | Financial Impact |\n|-----------|---------|------------------|\n| **Transition - Policy** | Carbon tax, emissions caps | Increased operating costs |\n| **Transition - Technology** | Clean tech disruption | Stranded assets, R&D costs |\n| **Transition - Market** | Shifting consumer preferences | Revenue decline |\n| **Transition - Reputation** | Stigmatization, greenwashing | Brand damage, talent loss |\n| **Physical - Acute** | Hurricanes, floods, fires | Asset damage, supply disruption |\n| **Physical - Chronic** | Sea level rise, temperature | Relocation, infrastructure costs |\n\n### TCFD Scoring\n\n| Dimension | 0 (None) | 1 (Partial) | 2 (Full) |\n|-----------|----------|------------|----------|\n| Governance disclosure | No mention | General statement | Detailed board/mgmt roles |\n| Strategy + Scenarios | No analysis | Qualitative only | Quantitative scenario analysis |\n| Risk management integration | Not integrated | Partially integrated | Fully integrated + disclosed |\n| Metrics + targets | No Scope data | Scope 1+2 only | All scopes + SBTi targets |\n| **Total TCFD Score** | 0/8 | 4/8 | 8/8 |",
