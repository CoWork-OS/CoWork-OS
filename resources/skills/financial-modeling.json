Read `{baseDir}/SKILL.md` for routing boundaries and expected outputs.\n2. Read `{baseDir}/references/full-guidance.md` for detailed procedures/examples.\n3. If `{baseDir}/scripts` exists, execute scripts instead of rewriting logic.\n4. Return outputs matching: Outcome from Financial Modeling: integrated three-statement model with driver assumptions, projected financials, scenario analysis, and model integrity checks..\n5. Verify success criteria: Returns a complete linked financial model with clearly stated assumptions, all three statements, working capital and debt schedules, scenario outputs, and balance checks..",
