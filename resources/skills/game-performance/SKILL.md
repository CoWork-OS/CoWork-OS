# Game Performance Optimization

## Purpose

Cross-engine game performance: draw call optimization, LOD, object pooling, GPU profiling, memory management, and platform-specific tuning.

## Routing

- Use when: Use when the user asks about game performance optimization, FPS improvement, draw call reduction, LOD configuration, object pooling, GPU profiling, memory optimization, or frame time budgeting in any game engine.
- Do not use when: Do not use for engine-specific coding tasks (use unity-development or unreal-development), or web/app performance optimization unrelated to games.
- Outputs: Performance analysis, optimization strategies, profiling guidance, and engine-specific configuration.
- Success criteria: Returns actionable optimization steps with measurable targets (FPS, draw calls, memory).

## Trigger Examples

### Positive

- Use the game-performance skill for this request.
- Help me with game performance optimization.
- Use when the user asks about game performance optimization, FPS improvement, draw call reduction, LOD configuration, object pooling, GPU profiling, memory optimization, or frame time budgeting in any game engine.
- Game Performance Optimization: provide an actionable result.

### Negative

- Do not use for engine-specific coding tasks (use unity-development or unreal-development), or web/app performance optimization unrelated to games.
- Do not use game-performance for unrelated requests.
- This request is outside game performance optimization scope.
- This is conceptual discussion only; no tool workflow is needed.
