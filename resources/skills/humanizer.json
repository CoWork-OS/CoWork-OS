Read `{baseDir}/SKILL.md` for routing boundaries and expected outputs.\n2. Read `{baseDir}/references/full-guidance.md` for detailed procedures/examples.\n3. If `{baseDir}/scripts` exists, execute scripts instead of rewriting logic.\n4. Return outputs matching: Rewritten text that reads naturally without AI writing markers.\n5. Verify success criteria: The output text would not be flagged by AI detection tools and reads like natural human writing.",
