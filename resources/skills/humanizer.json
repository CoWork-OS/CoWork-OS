  "prompt": "# Humanizer — Remove AI Writing Tells\n\nRewrite the provided text so it reads like a real human wrote it. Your job is to eliminate every detectable sign of AI-generated writing while preserving the original meaning, facts, and intent.\n\n## How to Use\n\nThe user will provide text to humanize. If they also specify a **tone** or **audience**, adapt accordingly. Otherwise, default to clear, conversational prose.\n\nIf a `{{tone}}` is specified, match that register. If `{{text}}` is provided via parameter, rewrite it directly.\n\n---\n\n## The 7 Layers of AI Tells\n\nFix all of these, in order of priority:\n\n### 1. Dead Giveaway Words & Phrases\n\nThese words almost never appear in natural human writing at the frequency LLMs use them. **Replace or delete every instance.**\n\n**Overused verbs:**\ndelve, explore, navigate, leverage, utilize, foster, bolster, spearhead, underscore, streamline, facilitate, encompass, embark, unravel, illuminate, exemplify, revolutionize, catapult, skyrocket, supercharge\n\n**Overused adjectives/adverbs:**\nseamless(ly), robust, comprehensive, cutting-edge, groundbreaking, innovative, transformative, pivotal, paramount, intricate, nuanced, multifaceted, holistic, dynamic, vibrant, meticulously, strategically, notably\n\n**Overused nouns:**\nlandscape, realm, tapestry, beacon, cornerstone, linchpin, catalyst, paradigm, synergy, ecosystem, framework, trajectory, underpinning, bedrock, nexus, interplay, confluence\n\n**Filler transitions (delete most of these):**\nMoreover, Furthermore, Additionally, In addition, It is worth noting that, It's important to note, Interestingly, Notably, Significantly, Indeed, In today's [X] landscape, In the realm of, When it comes to, In terms of, At the end of the day, That being said, Having said that, With that in mind, All in all, In conclusion, To sum up\n\n**Hollow intensifiers:**\na testament to, a beacon of hope, the power of, the beauty of, the importance of, serves as a reminder, plays a crucial role, at the heart of, the very fabric of, the ever-evolving, a deep dive into, sheds light on, paves the way for\n\n### 2. Structural Predictability\n\nAI writes in painfully predictable patterns. Break them:\n\n**The Identical Paragraph Template** — AI loves: topic sentence → supporting detail → supporting detail → wrap-up. Real writing varies. Some paragraphs are one sentence. Some start with an example. Some bury the point at the end.\n\n**The Rule of Three** — AI obsessively lists three things: \"innovation, collaboration, and excellence.\" Humans sometimes list two things. Sometimes four. Sometimes none.\n\n**Mirrored Section Lengths** — AI produces sections of suspiciously similar length. Real writing has uneven sections — a long deep-dive followed by a terse one-liner.\n\n**The Formulaic Opening** — AI starts with \"In today's rapidly evolving landscape of [topic]...\" or \"[Topic] has become increasingly important in recent years.\" Just start with the point.\n\n**The Conclusion That Restates Everything** — AI always ends with a summary paragraph starting with \"In conclusion\" that repeats every point. If the piece is short, just end. If it needs a conclusion, add a new thought.\n\n**Heading → Paragraph → Heading → Paragraph** — AI never varies the rhythm. Insert a short aside, a question, a single emphatic sentence between sections. Break the grid.\n\n### 3. Emotional Flatness & Hedging\n\nAI text is relentlessly balanced and never commits:\n\n- **Compulsive both-sidesing**: \"While X has its challenges, it also presents opportunities.\" Pick a side when appropriate. Have an opinion.\n- **Hedge stacking**: \"It could potentially be somewhat beneficial.\" Just say \"it helps\" or \"it probably helps.\"\n- **False enthusiasm**: \"Exciting developments\" / \"remarkable progress\" / \"truly inspiring.\" Use enthusiasm sparingly and only when warranted.\n- **Emotional uniformity**: Every paragraph has the same temperature. Real writing has moments of frustration, humor, bluntness, warmth, and indifference.\n\n### 4. Sentence-Level Mechanical Patterns\n\n- **Excessive em dashes** — AI uses em dashes 3-5x more than humans. Use them sparingly — one per page at most.\n- **Colon-list combo** — \"There are three key factors: X, Y, and Z.\" Just weave them into prose naturally.\n- **Gerund openers** — \"Leveraging AI capabilities, organizations can...\" Rewrite with a subject-verb start.\n- **Passive voice overuse** — \"It should be noted that improvements were made.\" Say who did what.\n- **Identical sentence starts** — AI often starts 3+ consecutive sentences with the same word (\"This\", \"The\", \"It\"). Vary your openings.\n- **Uniform sentence length** — AI sentences are almost all 15-25 words. Mix in short punchy ones. And occasionally a longer, more complex one that winds through a thought.\n\n### 5. Content-Level Tells\n\n- **Saying nothing while sounding smart** — AI writes confident sentences with zero information: \"Understanding the nuances of this complex issue is crucial for navigating the challenges ahead.\" Delete these.\n- **Restating the question as an introduction** — If asked about X, AI starts with \"X is a topic that...\" Skip the throat-clearing.\n- **Superficial analysis** — AI names things without analyzing them: \"Social media has had a significant impact on society.\" Go specific: what impact? On whom? When?\n- **Fake specificity** — AI uses \"various\", \"numerous\", \"a wide range of\", \"multiple factors\" instead of actual specifics. Name them or cut the claim.\n- **Promotional tone** — AI defaults to marketing copy: \"game-changing\", \"next-level\", \"best-in-class.\" Write like a journalist, not a brochure.\n\n### 6. Paragraph & Document-Level Tells\n\n- **The Five-Paragraph Essay** — AI defaults to intro + 3 body + conclusion. Vary the structure.\n- **Every paragraph is 3-5 sentences** — Real paragraphs range from 1 to 10+ sentences.\n- **Perfect topic-sentence discipline** — Not every paragraph needs to announce its subject in sentence one.\n- **No tangents or asides** — Real humans go on brief tangents, make parenthetical observations, and circle back. AI marches in a straight line.\n- **Bullet-point addiction** — AI converts everything to bulleted lists. Use lists only when the content genuinely calls for it.\n\n### 7. Vocabulary & Register\n\n- **Thesaurus syndrome** — AI avoids repeating words by swapping in fancy synonyms: \"said/stated/articulated/expressed/conveyed.\" Humans just say \"said\" again.\n- **Register mismatch** — AI uses formal academic diction in casual contexts. Match the register to the audience.\n- **Americanized defaults** — AI defaults to American English and American cultural references. Match the user's locale.\n- **No contractions** — AI underuses contractions. Real writing uses \"don't\", \"it's\", \"they're\" constantly in anything but formal academic writing.\n- **Overly precise hedge language** — \"approximately\", \"a significant number of\", \"in many cases.\" Humans say \"about\", \"a lot of\", \"often.\"\n\n---\n\n## Rewriting Process\n\n1. **Read the full text first** — understand the core message before touching anything\n2. **Strip the AI scaffolding** — remove filler transitions, hollow intensifiers, and throat-clearing intros\n3. **Vary the structure** — break predictable paragraph templates, mix sentence lengths, vary paragraph sizes\n4. **Replace flagged words** — swap every word from the lists above with plain, natural alternatives\n5. **Add human texture** — insert a brief aside, a question, a short emphatic sentence, or a moment of opinion where appropriate\n6. **Cut the fat** — AI text is typically 20-40% longer than it needs to be. Tighten ruthlessly\n7. **Read it aloud** — if any sentence sounds like a press release or textbook, rewrite it\n\n---\n\n## What to Preserve\n\n- All factual claims and data points\n- Technical terminology that's correct and necessary\n- The author's intended meaning and argument structure\n- Proper nouns, quotes, and citations\n- Any genuinely good phrasing (not everything AI writes is bad)\n\n## What NOT to Do\n\n- Don't make the text worse by being overly casual when formality is appropriate\n- Don't add false personal anecdotes or fabricated experiences\n- Don't change the meaning or introduce inaccuracies\n- Don't add humor where it's inappropriate (legal docs, medical info, etc.)\n- Don't just swap AI clichés for different clichés\n- Don't reduce complexity when the subject genuinely requires it\n\n---\n\n## Tone Adaptation\n\nIf the user specifies a tone, apply it:\n\n| Tone | Characteristics |\n|------|----------------|\n| **Casual** | Contractions, short sentences, conversational asides, informal vocab |\n| **Professional** | Clean and direct, no jargon for jargon's sake, confident but not stiff |\n| **Academic** | Precise language, longer sentences OK, hedging where scientifically appropriate, citations preserved |\n| **Journalistic** | Lead with the news, inverted pyramid, active voice, tight prose |\n| **Technical** | Exact terminology, no fluff, imperative mood for instructions |\n| **Warm/Personal** | First person, anecdotes welcome, emotional honesty, contractions |\n\n---\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn only the rewritten text. Do not include:\n- Explanations of what you changed\n- Before/after comparisons (unless the user asks)\n- Meta-commentary about the rewriting process\n\nJust deliver the clean, human-sounding text.",
