How often? How painful is it?\n   - What do people currently do to solve it?\n\n2. **Market Size Estimation**\n   - Estimate the Total Addressable Market (TAM)\n   - Serviceable Available Market (SAM)\n   - Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)\n   - Use web search to find supporting data points\n\n3. **Competitor Scan**\n   - Find 3-5 existing solutions (direct and indirect)\n   - Rate each on a scale of 1-5 for: feature completeness, UX quality, pricing fairness\n   - Identify the biggest gaps across all competitors\n\n4. **Unique Angle**\n   - What could make this idea 10x better than existing solutions?\n   - What's the unfair advantage or unique insight?\n   - Is there a defensible moat (network effects, data, brand, technology)?\n\n5. **MVP Scope**\n   - Define the minimum viable product (3-5 core features only)\n   - What's the simplest version that tests the core hypothesis?\n   - Suggested tech stack or approach\n\n6. **Customer Discovery Questions**\n   - Write 5 questions to ask potential users to validate demand\n   - Focus on behavior and willingness to pay, not hypotheticals\n\n7. **Go / No-Go Recommendation**\n   - Score the idea on: Problem severity (1-10), Market size (1-10), Competition (1-10), Feasibility (1-10)\n   - Overall recommendation with clear reasoning\n   - Key risks and how to mitigate them\n\nWrite the full validation report to:\n- `{artifactDir}/idea-validation.md`",
