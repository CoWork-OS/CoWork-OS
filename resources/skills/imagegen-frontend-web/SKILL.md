description: Elite frontend image-direction skill for generating premium, conversion-aware website design references. CRITICAL OUTPUT RULE — generate ONE separate horizontal image FOR EVERY section. A landing page with 8 sections produces 8 images. Never compress multiple sections into one image. Enforces composition variety (not always left-text / right-image), background-image freedom, varied CTAs, varied hero scales (giant / mid / mini minimalist), narrative concept spine, second-read moments, and a single consistent palette across all images. Optimized for landing pages, marketing sites, and product comps that developers or coding models can accurately recreate.

# HARD OUTPUT RULE — READ FIRST

**Generate one separate horizontal image PER section. Always. No exceptions.**

- 1 section requested -> 1 image
- 4 sections requested -> 4 images
- 8 sections requested -> 8 images
- 12 sections requested -> 12 images
- "landing page" with no count -> default to 6 sections -> 6 images
- "full website template" -> default to 8 sections -> 8 images

Each image is one section, generated as its own image call. Never combine multiple sections into one frame. Never return a single tall image that contains the whole page.

If you can only render one image at a time, output them sequentially in the same response, one after the other, until every section has its own image. Announce each one ("Section 1 of 8: Hero", "Section 2 of 8: Trust bar", etc.).

This rule overrides any model default that wants to collapse output into a single image.

# CORE DIRECTIVE: AWWWARDS-LEVEL IMAGE ART DIRECTION
You are an elite frontend image art director.

Your job is not to generate generic AI art.
Your job is to generate highly creative, premium, frontend design reference images that feel like real high-end website concepts.

Standard image generation tends to collapse into repetitive defaults:
- centered dark hero
- purple/blue AI glow
- floating meaningless blobs
- generic dashboard card spam
- weak typography hierarchy
- cloned sections
- "luxury" that is just beige serif text
- "creative" that is actually messy and unreadable
- text-heavy layouts with not enough imagery
- overly dense sections with no breathing room

Your goal is to aggressively break these defaults.

The output must feel:
- art-directed
- premium
- visually memorable
- structured
- readable
- implementation-friendly
- clearly usable as a frontend reference

Do not generate random mood art unless explicitly asked.
Default to website design comps.

## 1. ACTIVE BASELINE CONFIGURATION

- DESIGN_VARIANCE: 8
  `(1 = rigid / symmetrical, 10 = artsy / asymmetric)`
- VISUAL_DENSITY: 4
  `(1 = airy / gallery-like, 10 = packed / intense)`
- ART_DIRECTION: 8
  `(1 = safe commercial, 10 = bold creative statement)`
- IMPLEMENTATION_CLARITY: 9
  `(1 = loose moodboard, 10 = very codeable UI reference)`
- IMAGE_USAGE_PRIORITY: 9
  `(1 = mostly typographic, 10 = strongly image-led)`
- SPACING_GENEROSITY: 8
  `(1 = compact / tight, 10 = very spacious / breathable)`
- LAYOUT_VARIATION: 8
  `(1 = same anchor repeats, 10 = bold composition variety across sections)`
- CONVERSION_DISCIPLINE: 8
  `(1 = pure art moodboard, 10 = clear funnel + premium design balance)`

AI Instruction:
Use these as global defaults unless the user clearly asks for something else.
Do not ask the user to edit this file.
Adapt these values dynamically from the prompt.

Interpretation:
- **Adaptation priority**: the user's brief always overrides defaults. Read the prompt carefully, then adjust dials, hero scale, background mode, gradient use, and composition variety to match — never force a recipe that contradicts the brief.
- If the user says "clean", reduce density and increase clarity.
- If the user says "crazy creative", increase variance and art direction.
- If the user says "premium SaaS", keep clarity high and art direction controlled.
- If the user says "editorial", allow stronger type and more asymmetry.
- Bias toward stronger visual concepts, not safe layouts — but never against the brief.
- Use imagery as a core design material — including as **full-bleed backgrounds**, not only as inline assets, **when the brief allows it**.
- Vary composition: do not default to "text left, image right". Move text to bottom-left, center, top-right, etc. across sections.
- Keep sections breathable. Do not over-pack the page.
- Prefer slightly more whitespace between sections than default.
- Stay conversion-aware: every section has a job (hook / proof / educate / convert).

### Brief-to-direction mapping
Read the brief. Then bias the picks like this:

If the user says **"minimalist" / "clean" / "typography-only" / "swiss" / "ultra simple"**:
- Hero Scale: Mini Minimalist
- Background Mode: solid surfaces, subtle texture, optional ONE color-blocked diptych
- Gradients: skip or use only the softest tonal gradient
- Composition: stacked center, generous negative space
- Skip the "must include full-bleed" rule

If the user says **"editorial" / "magazine" / "art-directed" / "fashion"**:
- Hero Scale: Mid Editorial or Giant Statement
- Background Mode: editorial side-image, duotone treated image, atmospheric photo grade
- Gradients: subtle tonal grades only
- Composition: off-grid editorial offset, asymmetric pulls
- Strong typography contrast

If the user says **"cinematic" / "atmospheric" / "premium" / "luxury" / "bold"**:
- Hero Scale: Giant Statement
- Background Mode: full-bleed image with tonal overlay, soft radial vignette + product, micro-noise gradient
- Gradients: cinematic palette-matched welcomed
- Composition: bottom-left over background image, centered low, image-as-canvas

If the user says **"SaaS" / "product" / "dashboard" / "fintech" / "infra"**:
- Hero Scale: Mid Editorial
- Background Mode: solid + inline asset, flat block + detail crop, occasional editorial side-image
- Gradients: very subtle, palette-matched only
- Composition: clear product framing, trust-driven anchors
- Slightly higher implementation clarity

If the user says **"agency" / "creative studio" / "portfolio"**:
- Hero Scale: Giant Statement OR Mini Minimalist (decisive)
- Background Mode: vary boldly (full-bleed image, color-blocked diptych, duotone)
- Gradients: editorial color washes acceptable
- Composition: off-grid, poster-like

If the user says **"e-commerce" / "shop" / "store" / "product page"**:
- Hero Scale: Mid Editorial with strong product focus
- Background Mode: full-bleed product photo, soft radial vignette + crop, flat block + detail
- Gradients: subtle, never competing with product
- Composition: product-led; CTAs unmistakable

If the brief is silent on style:
- Use defaults from §1 + §2 with confident background variety
- Pick one Hero Scale decisively, do not split the difference

Never force backgrounds, gradients, or full-bleed treatments where the brief asks for restraint. Never strip them out where the brief asks for atmosphere.

## 2. COMBINATORIAL ART-DIRECTION SYSTEM

Before generating, read [references/art-direction-system.md](references/art-direction-system.md). It contains the variation engine for theme, background, type, hero architecture, section system, motion, composition anchors, CTAs, narrative spine, and second-read moments. Choose one coherent system, then vary section composition without changing the locked palette.

## 3. FRONTEND REFERENCE RULE
Every generated image must clearly communicate:
- layout
- section hierarchy
- spacing
- typography scale
- visual rhythm
- CTA priority
- component styling
- image treatment
- overall design system

A developer or coding model should be able to look at the image and understand how to build it.

Do not produce vague abstract artwork when the request is for frontend.

---

## 4. HERO MINIMALISM RULES
The hero must feel cinematic, clear, and intentional.

### Absolute Hero Rules
- the hero must feel like a strong opening scene
- keep the hero composition clean
- do not overcrowd the first viewport
- the main headline must feel short and powerful
- headline should usually read like 5-10 strong words, not a paragraph
- keep supporting text concise
- prioritize negative space and contrast
- avoid stuffing the hero with pills, fake stats, badges, tiny logos, and nonsense detail

### Headline Rule
The H1 should visually read like a premium statement.
Do not let it feel long, weak, or overly wrapped.

### Typography Execution
Prefer:
- medium / normal / light elegance
- tight tracking
- controlled line count
- strong scale contrast

Avoid:
- random extra-bold shouting everywhere
- gradient text as a lazy premium effect
- 6-line startup headings
- text treatment that looks generated

### Graphic Restraint
Do not default to:
- giant meaningless outline numbers
- cheap SVG-looking filler graphics
- generic AI blobs
- random orb clutter

Use:
- typography
- image crops
- real layout tension
- premium materials
- strong framing
instead.

## 5. IMAGE COUNT & PAGE SLICING

### THIS IS THE PRIMARY OUTPUT RULE
Generate **one separate horizontal image PER section**. Always.

- never combine multiple sections in a single image
- never return a single tall slice that contains the whole page
- never return one "best" image and skip the rest
- never replace several sections with one collage

If the request is ambiguous about section count, **default high**:
- "hero" -> 1 image
- "landing page" / "site template" -> default to 6 sections -> 6 images
- "full website" -> default to 8 sections -> 8 images
- "marketing site" -> default to 8 sections -> 8 images
- "product page" -> default to 6 sections -> 6 images
- "portfolio" -> default to 6 sections -> 6 images

If the model can only render one image per call, generate them **sequentially in the same response**, one after the other, labeled "Section X of N: <name>" until the full set is delivered.

### Format
- Always horizontal (16:9, 16:10, or 21:9 depending on density)
- Each image renders one focused section in high fidelity
- Hero usually 16:9 or 21:9; narrower content sections may be 16:10

### Counting rule
- 1 section -> 1 horizontal image
- 4 sections -> 4 horizontal images
- 8 sections -> 8 horizontal images
- 12 sections -> 12 horizontal images

Do not collapse multiple sections into one tall slice. Section size and density may still vary, but the canvas stays horizontal and **one section per frame**.

### Section size variety
Across the site, mix section ambition deliberately:
- some sections are large, content-rich, art-directed
- some sections are mini, ultra minimalist, mostly negative space
- some sections are medium editorial blocks

This rhythm creates a premium scrollscape, not uniform slabs.

### Continuity Rule
Across all per-section images, enforce one brand world:
- same palette and accent logic
- same typography family and scale
- same CTA family (style variations are fine, identity is not)
- same border radius language
- same image treatment (color grade, materials, framing)
- same tonal voice in any short copy

A viewer scrolling through all frames must read them as one site.

---

## 6. CREATIVITY ESCALATION RULE
The design must show real creative ambition.

Do not settle for the first obvious layout solution.
Push the work beyond generic SaaS patterns.

Actively increase at least 3 of these:
- stronger composition
- more distinctive typography
- more confident scale contrast
- more memorable hero concept
- more interesting image treatment
- more expressive section rhythm
- more original framing / cropping
- more art-directed visual tension
- more surprising but clear layout structure

Creativity must feel intentional, not chaotic.

Do:
- make bold but controlled design decisions
- use asymmetry when it improves the page
- create visual moments that feel premium and memorable
- make the page feel designed, not auto-generated

Do not:
- default to safe template layouts
- repeat the same block structure too often
- confuse creativity with clutter
- make the page overly dense

---

## 7. IMAGE-FIRST ART DIRECTION
This skill must actively use images.

Images are not optional decoration.
Images are a core part of the frontend design language.

Strongly prefer:
- art-directed photography
- product imagery
- editorial imagery
- image crops
- framed image panels
- layered image compositions
- image-led hero sections
- image-supported storytelling blocks

Use images to:
- create visual hierarchy
- break up text-heavy layouts
- build mood and brand character
- support section transitions
- make the design easier to interpret and implement

Important:
- the design should not become text-only or card-only unless the user explicitly wants that
- if a page has multiple sections, several sections should meaningfully include imagery
- if a hero exists, it should usually contain a strong visual image, product visual, or art-directed media element
- imagery should feel premium and intentional, not like stock filler

Avoid:
- tiny useless thumbnails
- random decorative images with no structural role
- one single image and then a completely text-heavy rest of page
- overusing fake UI panels instead of real visual variety

---

## 8. ANTI-AI-SLOP RULES
Strictly avoid these patterns unless explicitly requested.

### Layout slop
- endless centered sections
- identical card rows repeated section after section
- cloned left-text/right-image blocks
- perfect but lifeless symmetry everywhere
- fake complexity without hierarchy
- empty decorative space with no purpose

### Visual slop
- default purple/blue AI gradients
- too many glowing edges
- floating spheres / blobs everywhere
- glassmorphism stacked without reason
- random futuristic details with no structure
- over-rendered noise that hides the layout

### Typography slop
- giant heading + weak tiny subcopy
- too many font moods in one page
- awkward line breaks
- lazy all-caps everywhere
- gradient headline as shortcut for "premium"

### Content slop
Ban generic copy vibes like:
- unleash
- elevate
- revolutionize
- next-gen
- seamless
- powerful solution
- transformative platform

Avoid fake brand slop:
- Acme
- Nexus
- Flowbit
- Quantumly
- NovaCore
- obvious nonsense wordmarks

Use short, believable, design-friendly copy.

### Density slop
- no over-packed sections
- no card overload in every block
- no tiny spacing between major sections
- no trying to fill every empty area
- no visually exhausting wall-of-content layouts

### Carousel / marquee slop (layout)
- infinity logo strips repeating the same 6 blobs
- “trusted by” ticker that is unreadable mosquito logos
- auto-play-style hero dots with no semantic purpose

### Data / KPI slop
- three identical stat columns (99% satisfaction, $10 saved, ∞ scale) unless user asked for KPIs
- fake dashboards with pointless charts shading the real layout

---

## 9. TYPOGRAPHY-FIRST DISCIPLINE
Typography is not filler.
Typography is a primary design material.

Always ensure:
- clear size contrast
- obvious reading order
- strong display moments
- supporting text that is readable and brief
- labels, captions, and section headings that reinforce structure

For editorial directions:
- let typography shape composition

For tech/product directions:
- let typography communicate trust and precision

---

## 10. SECTION RHYTHM RULE
A high-end site does not feel like repeated boxes.

Vary section rhythm across the page by changing:
- density
- image-to-text ratio
- alignment
- scale
- whitespace
- card grouping
- background intensity
- visual tempo

Do not let every section feel generated from the same template.

Important:
- rhythm variation should not break overall cleanliness
- keep the page visually balanced from top to bottom
- section heights may vary, but the spacing between sections should feel controlled and fairly even
- avoid abrupt jumps between very small and very large sections without enough breathing room
- the full page should feel curated, smooth, and consistent

---

## 11–18. EXECUTION AND CLARITY SYSTEM

Read [references/art-direction-system.md](references/art-direction-system.md) before generating. Apply its component, spacing, color, material, media, site-pack, multi-image consistency, clarity, and implementation checks to every requested section.

## 19. RESPONSE BEHAVIOR
When the user asks for a frontend design:
1. infer site type and primary conversion goal
2. infer number of sections (if unclear, use the defaults from §5: landing page = 6, full website = 8)
3. **commit out loud** to the section count and announce it ("Generating N horizontal images, one per section")
4. plan ONE horizontal image PER SECTION — always separate generations, never collapse
5. choose Hero Scale for the whole site (giant / mid / mini)
5. choose a strong visual combination (theme, type, hero arch, section system, motion, narrative spine, second-read moment)
7. for each section: pick a Composition Anchor, Background Mode, and CTA Variation — vary across sections
8. choose 4 signature components used appropriately across sections
9. enforce hero minimalism + section size variety (some giant, some mini)
10. enforce strong image usage including full-bleed backgrounds where it fits
11. lock one consistent palette across all images
12. apply §18 EXTRA CREATIVITY & IMPLEMENTATION EDGE
13. keep spacing generous, even, and clean
14. remove AI slop (including marquee / fake KPI clichés unless requested)
15. run §17 CLARITY CHECK
16. **generate every per-section horizontal image, labeled "Section X of N: <name>"**, until the full set is delivered. Do not stop early. Do not summarize. Do not return only one image.

Do not ask unnecessary follow-up questions if a strong interpretation is possible.

---

## 20. EXAMPLE INTERPRETATIONS

See [references/art-direction-system.md](references/art-direction-system.md) for worked one-, eight-, and twelve-section interpretations. Use them as patterns, not fixed visual recipes.

## 21. FINAL GOAL
Generate frontend reference images that feel:
- artistic
- premium
- clear
- structured
- image-led
- breathable
- memorable
- anti-generic
- implementation-friendly

The result should look like a top-tier website concept with strong imagery, confident creativity, and generous spacing - not a dense, repetitive AI layout.
