# iOS Development

## Purpose

iOS/Swift development: SwiftUI, UIKit, Core Data, Xcode builds, simulator management, code signing, and App Store submission.

## Routing

- Use when: Use when the user asks about iOS development, Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, Xcode, Core Data, SwiftData, App Store submission, TestFlight, or iOS simulator management.
- Do not use when: Do not use for Android development (use android-development), React Native (use the mobile pack's react-native skill), or general mobile CI/CD (use the mobile pack's build-pipeline skill).
- Outputs: Swift code, SwiftUI views, Xcode commands, and iOS development guidance.
- Success criteria: Returns valid Swift/SwiftUI code or Xcode CLI commands.

- iOS Development: provide an actionable result.

### Negative

- Do not use for Android development (use android-development), React Native (use the mobile pack's react-native skill), or general mobile CI/CD (use the mobile pack's build-pipeline skill).
- Do not use ios-development for unrelated requests.
- This request is outside ios development scope.
- This is conceptual discussion only; no tool workflow is needed.
