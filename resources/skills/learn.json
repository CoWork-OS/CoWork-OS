Acknowledge what the user wants you to learn.\n2. Store the learning as a memory using the appropriate method based on category:\n   - If category is \"preference\": Also note it as a user preference for future reference.\n   - If category is \"correction\": Frame it as a mistake to avoid repeating.\n   - If category is \"rule\": Frame it as a constraint to always follow.\n   - If category is \"insight\": Frame it as a useful pattern or knowledge.\n3. Write a one-line summary of the learning to the workspace file `.cowork/MEMORY.md` (create the file if it doesn't exist, append to the appropriate section if it does). Use the format:\n   - `- [{{category}}] {{what}} (recorded on current date)`\n4. Confirm to the user what was recorded and where.\n\n## RULES\n- Do NOT ask clarifying questions. Record exactly what the user said.\n- Keep the stored text concise (under 200 characters).\n- If the learning contradicts a previous memory, note the update.\n- Never store sensitive data (API keys, passwords, tokens).",
