# Oracle

## Purpose

Best practices for using the oracle CLI (prompt + file bundling, engines, sessions, and file attachment patterns).

## Routing

- Use when: Use when the user asks to best practices for using the oracle CLI prompt + file bundling, engines, sessions, and file attachment patterns.
- Do not use when: Do not use when the request is asking for planning documents, high-level strategy, or non-executable discussion; use the relevant planning or design workflow instead.
- Outputs: Outcome from Oracle: task-specific result plus concrete action notes.
- Success criteria: Returns concrete actions and decisions matching the requested task, with no fabricated tool-side behavior.
