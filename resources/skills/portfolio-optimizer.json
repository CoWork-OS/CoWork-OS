Read `{baseDir}/SKILL.md` for routing boundaries and expected outputs.\n2. Read `{baseDir}/references/full-guidance.md` for detailed procedures/examples.\n3. If `{baseDir}/scripts` exists, execute scripts instead of rewriting logic.\n4. Return outputs matching: Outcome from Portfolio Optimizer: optimized asset allocation with weights, expected return, risk metrics, efficient frontier positioning, and rebalancing recommendations..\n5.
