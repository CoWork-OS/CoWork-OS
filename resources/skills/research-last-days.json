  "prompt": "Research \"{{topic}}\" from the past {{days}} days.\n\nIMPORTANT: Use the EXACT search term \"{{topic}}\" as provided. Do NOT interpret, correct, or modify the search term.\n\nDetermine the best dateRange for web_search based on the number of days:\n- If {{days}} is 1: use dateRange: \"day\"\n- If {{days}} is 2-7: use dateRange: \"week\"\n- If {{days}} is 8-30: use dateRange: \"month\"\n- If {{days}} is 31+: use dateRange: \"year\"\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Use the web_search tool with the appropriate dateRange determined above\n2. Run multiple targeted searches:\n   - web_search(query: \"{{topic}}\" news, dateRange: <determined>)\n   - web_search(query: \"{{topic}}\" site:reddit.com, dateRange: <determined>)\n   - web_search(query: \"{{topic}}\" discussion, dateRange: <determined>)\n   - web_search(query: \"{{topic}}\" announcement, dateRange: <determined>)\n3.
