Read `{baseDir}/SKILL.md` for routing boundaries and expected outputs.\n2. Read `{baseDir}/references/full-guidance.md` for detailed procedures/examples.\n3. If `{baseDir}/scripts` exists, execute scripts instead of rewriting logic.\n4. Return outputs matching: Outcome from Risk Analyzer: comprehensive risk assessment with VaR/CVaR calculations, stress test results, factor exposures, drawdown analysis, and risk management recommendations..\n5. Verify success criteria: Returns quantified risk metrics at the specified confidence level and horizon, identifies key risk concentrations, provides stress test impacts, and recommends actionable risk mitigation steps..",
