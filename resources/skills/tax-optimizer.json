  "prompt": "# Tax Optimization Request\n\n**Portfolio:** {{portfolio}}\n**Strategy:** {{strategy}}\n**Question:** {{question}}\n\n**Tax Bracket:** {{taxBracket}}\n**Filing Status:** {{filingStatus}}\n\nUsing the tax optimization framework below, analyze the portfolio and recommend tax-efficient strategies. Apply the specified strategy focus area while considering the taxpayer's bracket and filing status.\n\n---\n\n# Tax Optimization Reference\n\n## Capital Gains Tax Rates (2024)\n\n### Long-Term Capital Gains (held > 1 year)\n\n| Filing Status | 0% Rate | 15% Rate | 20% Rate |\n|--------------|---------|----------|----------|\n| Single | Up to $47,025 | $47,026-$518,900 | Over $518,900 |\n| MFJ | Up to $94,050 | $94,051-$583,750 | Over $583,750 |\n| MFS | Up to $47,025 | $47,026-$291,850 | Over $291,850 |\n| HoH | Up to $63,000 | $63,001-$551,350 | Over $551,350 |\n\n### Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)\n\n3.8% surtax on lesser of: net investment income OR MAGI exceeding:\n- Single: $200,000\n- MFJ: $250,000\n- MFS: $125,000\n\n**Effective maximum LTCG rate: 20% + 3.8% NIIT = 23.8%**\n\n### Short-Term Capital Gains (held <= 1 year)\n\nTaxed as ordinary income at marginal rates:\n\n| Bracket | Single | MFJ |\n|---------|--------|-----|\n| 10% | $0-$11,600 | $0-$23,200 |\n| 12% | $11,601-$47,150 | $23,201-$94,300 |\n| 22% | $47,151-$100,525 | $94,301-$201,050 |\n| 24% | $100,526-$191,950 | $201,051-$383,900 |\n| 32% | $191,951-$243,725 | $383,901-$487,450 |\n| 35% | $243,726-$609,350 | $487,451-$731,200 |\n| 37% | Over $609,350 | Over $731,200 |\n\n### Qualified Dividends\n\nSame rates as long-term capital gains. Must hold stock > 60 days during 121-day window around ex-dividend date.\n\n### Ordinary Dividends (Non-Qualified)\n\nTaxed at ordinary income rates. Includes: REIT dividends, money market dividends, foreign stock dividends (some), short holding period dividends.\n\n## Tax-Loss Harvesting\n\n### Core Strategy\n\nSell investments at a loss to offset capital gains and reduce tax liability, then reinvest in similar (but not substantially identical) securities to maintain market exposure.\n\n### Tax Benefit Calculation\n\n**Offset gains:** LTCL offsets LTCG; STCL offsets STCG first (netting rules apply)\n**Excess losses:** Up to $3,000/year ($1,500 MFS) offsets ordinary income\n**Carryforward:** Unused losses carry forward indefinitely\n\n**Tax savings = Harvested Loss x Applicable Tax Rate**\n\n| Loss Type | Offsets | Tax Savings per $10K Loss |\n|-----------|---------|---------------------------|\n| STCL offsetting STCG | Short-term gains | $2,200-$3,700 (at marginal rate) |\n| LTCL offsetting LTCG | Long-term gains | $1,500-$2,380 |\n| Excess vs ordinary income | Up to $3K ordinary | $1,200-$3,700 (at marginal rate) |\n\n### Wash Sale Rule\n\n**The 61-Day Window:**\nCannot purchase a \"substantially identical\" security within 30 days BEFORE or 30 days AFTER the sale (total 61-day window).\n\n**Substantially identical includes:**\n- Same stock or bond\n- Options or contracts to acquire the same security\n- Same mutual fund or ETF with identical strategy\n- Purchasing in IRA or spouse's account (still triggers wash sale)\n\n**NOT substantially identical (safe replacements):**\n\n| Sold Position | Safe Replacement | Rationale |\n|--------------|-----------------|----------|\n| S&P 500 ETF (SPY) | Total Market ETF (VTI) | Different index |\n| Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO) | iShares S&P 500 (IVV) | Potentially identical - use caution |\n| Individual stock (AAPL) | Sector ETF (XLK) | Different security |\n| US Total Market (VTI) | International Developed (VEA) | Different market |\n| Bond fund (BND) | Different duration bond fund (BSV) | Different strategy |\n| Growth ETF (VUG) | Value ETF (VTV) | Different factor |\n\n**Wash sale consequence:** Disallowed loss is added to cost basis of replacement purchase, deferring (not eliminating) the tax benefit.\n\n### Direct Indexing\n\nOwn individual stocks that replicate an index instead of an ETF. This enables:\n- Harvesting losses on individual stocks while maintaining index exposure\n- Estimated 1-2% annual tax alpha in early years\n- Diminishing benefit over time as cost basis rises\n- Ideal for portfolios > $250K in taxable accounts\n\n### Optimal Harvesting Frequency\n\n| Frequency | Tax Alpha | Complexity |\n|-----------|-----------|------------|\n| Annual | ~0.5-1.0% | Low |\n| Quarterly | ~1.0-1.5% | Medium |\n| Monthly | ~1.2-1.8% | High |\n| Daily (automated) | ~1.5-2.0% | Very High (software) |\n\n## Asset Location Optimization\n\n### Core Principle\n\nPlace tax-inefficient assets in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient assets in taxable accounts to maximize after-tax returns.\n\n### Asset Location Matrix\n\n| Asset Type | Tax Efficiency | Best Location | Reason |\n|-----------|---------------|---------------|--------|\n| **Tax-INEFFICIENT (put in tax-advantaged)** | | | |\n| Taxable bonds | Low | Traditional IRA/401k | Interest taxed as ordinary income |\n| REITs | Low | Traditional IRA/401k | Dividends taxed as ordinary income |\n| High-turnover active funds | Low | Traditional IRA/401k | Frequent short-term gains |\n| TIPS | Low | Traditional IRA/401k | Phantom income on inflation adjustment |\n| Commodities (K-1 funds) | Low | Traditional IRA/401k | Complex tax, ordinary income |\n| High-yield bonds | Low | Traditional IRA/401k | Interest as ordinary income |\n| **Tax-EFFICIENT (put in taxable)** | | | |\n| Broad index funds/ETFs | High | Taxable | Low turnover, qualified dividends |\n| Growth stocks (low/no dividend) | High | Taxable | Defer gains, step-up at death |\n| Municipal bonds | Very High | Taxable | Tax-exempt income |\n| Tax-managed funds | High | Taxable | Designed for tax efficiency |\n| International stocks/funds | Moderate | Taxable | Foreign tax credit available |\n| **HIGHEST-GROWTH (put in Roth)** | | | |\n| Small-cap growth | N/A | Roth IRA/401k | Tax-free growth maximized |\n| Emerging markets | N/A | Roth IRA/401k | Highest expected growth tax-free |\n| High-conviction individual stocks | N/A | Roth IRA/401k | Unlimited upside, tax-free |\n\n### After-Tax Return Improvement\n\nProper asset location can add 0.25-0.75% annually to after-tax portfolio returns, depending on portfolio size, asset mix, and tax bracket.\n\n## Roth Conversion Analysis\n\n### Roth Conversion Math\n\n**Breakeven Analysis:**\nConvert when: Future tax rate > Current tax rate on conversion\n\n**Breakeven years formula:**\nBreakeven ≈ Tax paid / (Marginal tax rate differential x Annual growth rate)\n\nMore precisely:\nRoth ending value = Conversion Amount x (1 + r)^n\nTraditional ending value = [Conversion Amount x (1 + r)^n] x (1 - Future Tax Rate) + [Tax Saved x (1 + r_at)^n]\n\nConvert if: Roth ending value > Traditional ending value\n\n### Roth Conversion Opportunity Windows\n\n| Situation | Opportunity | Action |\n|-----------|------------|--------|\n| Low-income year | Marginal rate drop | Fill up lower brackets |\n| Early retirement (before SS/RMDs) | Income gap years | Convert up to top of 22% or 24% bracket |\n| Market downturn | Lower account values | Convert more shares for same tax cost |\n| Large charitable year | Offsetting deductions | Convert offset by charitable deduction |\n| Business loss year | NOL offset | Convert offset by net operating loss |\n| Before SECURE Act RMDs | 73+ distributions | Reduce future RMD tax burden |\n\n### Roth Conversion Guardrails\n\n**Convert up to, but not above these thresholds:**\n- Top of 24% bracket: $201,050 (MFJ) taxable income\n- IRMAA threshold: $206,000 MAGI (MFJ) for Medicare surcharge\n- ACA subsidy cliff: 400% FPL if on marketplace insurance\n- NIIT threshold: $250,000 MAGI (MFJ)\n\n### Five-Year Rule\n\nConverted amounts: 5-year waiting period for penalty-free withdrawal of converted amounts (if under 59.5). Each conversion has its own 5-year clock.\n\n## Capital Gains Management\n\n### Lot Selection Methods\n\n| Method | Description | Best Use |\n|--------|------------|----------|\n| FIFO (First In, First Out) | Default; sell oldest shares first | Rarely optimal |\n| LIFO (Last In, First Out) | Sell newest shares first | Short-term loss harvesting |\n| Specific Identification | Choose exactly which lots to sell | Maximum tax control |\n| Highest Cost | Sell highest cost basis first | Minimize current gains |\n| Lowest Cost | Sell lowest cost basis first | Maximize current gains (when needed) |\n| Tax-Lot Optimization | Algorithm selects optimal lots | Best overall tax result |\n\n**Always use Specific Identification for maximum control.** Notify broker BEFORE the trade settles.\n\n### Gain Deferral Strategies\n\n| Strategy | Mechanism | Tax Benefit |\n|----------|-----------|------------|\n| Hold > 1 year | LTCG rates | Save 10-20% vs ordinary rates |\n| Harvest losses to offset | Loss netting | Direct offset of gains |\n| Charitable donation of appreciated stock | Avoid gains + deduction | Double benefit |\n| Installment sale | Spread recognition | Defer to lower-bracket years |\n| Opportunity Zone investment | 1031-like deferral | Defer + potential exclusion |\n| Step-up in basis at death | Estate planning | Complete elimination of gains |\n| Donor-Advised Fund | Immediate deduction | Avoid gains on donated shares |\n\n## Charitable Giving Strategies\n\n### Donor-Advised Fund (DAF)\n\n**Mechanism:** Contribute cash or appreciated assets to DAF, receive immediate tax deduction, grant to charities over time.\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Immediate deduction in high-income year\n- Avoid capital gains on appreciated stock\n- Bunching strategy: contribute 2-3 years of giving in one year to itemize, take standard deduction in other years\n\n**Deduction limits:**\n- Cash to DAF: Up to 60% of AGI\n- Appreciated property: Up to 30% of AGI\n- Carryforward: 5 years for unused deductions\n\n### Bunching Strategy Example\n\n| Approach | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | 3-Year Total Deduction |\n|----------|--------|--------|--------|------------------------|\n| Annual $10K gift | $10K (std ded used) | $10K (std ded used) | $10K (std ded used) | ~$0 incremental |\n| Bunch $30K in Year 1 | $30K (itemize) | $0 (std ded) | $0 (std ded) | ~$30K - std ded |\n\n### Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD)\n\nFor taxpayers age 70.5+:\n- Distribute up to $105,000/year directly from IRA to charity\n- Excludes distribution from taxable income (better than deduction)\n- Counts toward Required Minimum Distribution\n- Cannot use for DAF contributions\n\n### Appreciated Stock Donation\n\n| Scenario | Cash Donation | Stock Donation | Difference |\n|----------|--------------|----------------|------------|\n| Donation amount | $10,000 | $10,000 FMV | Same |\n| Capital gains avoided | $0 | $7,000 gain | $7,000 |\n| Tax on avoided gains (23.8%) | $0 | $1,666 saved | $1,666 |\n| Charitable deduction (37%) | $3,700 | $3,700 | Same |\n| **Total tax benefit** | **$3,700** | **$5,366** | **+$1,666** |\n\n**Rule:** Must have held the stock > 1 year. Deduction at FMV (not cost basis).\n\n## Tax-Efficient Withdrawal Sequencing (Retirement)\n\n### General Order of Withdrawals\n\n1. **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)** - Must take first\n2. **Taxable account** - Capital gains rates, step-up potential\n3. **Traditional IRA/401k** - Fill up lower brackets\n4. **Roth IRA** - Last (tax-free growth for longest)\n\n### Dynamic Withdrawal Strategy\n\nAdjust annually based on:\n- Current year tax bracket space\n- Roth conversion opportunities\n- Capital gain/loss harvesting opportunities\n- Medicare IRMAA thresholds\n- Social Security provisional income\n\n## Annual Tax Optimization Checklist\n\n| Month | Action | Purpose |\n|-------|--------|---------|\n| January | Review prior year tax position | Set strategy for current year |\n| March | Roth conversion planning | Model bracket space |\n| June | Mid-year tax projection | Adjust estimated payments |\n| September | Tax-loss harvesting review | Capture YTD opportunities |\n| October | Charitable giving execution | Bunch contributions if beneficial |\n| November | Year-end capital gains estimates | Fund distributions impact |\n| December | Final loss harvesting + Roth conversion | Last chance for current year |",
