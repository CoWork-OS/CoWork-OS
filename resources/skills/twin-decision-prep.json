For each:\n   - Description of the option\n   - Pros (benefits, advantages)\n   - Cons (risks, downsides, costs)\n   - Effort estimate (relative: low/medium/high)\n   - Reversibility (easy to reverse / hard to reverse / one-way door)\n4. **Data**: Relevant metrics, benchmarks, precedents, or external research that informs the decision.\n5. **Stakeholder input**: Known positions or concerns from stakeholders (if available from context).\n6. **Recommendation**: Based on the available data, which option appears strongest? Clearly label this as a suggestion for human decision-making, not a decision.\n7. **Open questions**: What additional information would improve this decision?\n\nWrite to `{artifactDir}/decision-package.md`.",
