  "prompt": "# Web Scraper (Scrapling)\n\nScrape web pages with advanced anti-bot bypass, stealth browsing, and structured data extraction.\n\n## Available Tools\n\n- `scrape_page`: Scrape a single URL with anti-bot bypass\n- `scrape_multiple`: Batch scrape multiple URLs\n- `scrape_extract`: Extract structured data (tables, lists, headings)\n- `scrape_session`: Multi-step session with persistent state\n- `scraping_status`: Check if Scrapling is installed\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. First check if Scrapling is available using `scraping_status`\n2. Use the URL provided: {{url}}\n3. Choose the appropriate fetcher:\n   - `default`: Fast HTTP with TLS fingerprinting (try first)\n   - `stealth`: Cloudflare/Turnstile bypass (if default fails)\n   - `playwright`: Full browser for JS-heavy sites\n4. If a CSS selector is provided, use it: {{selector}}\n5. Extract the requested content and format it clearly\n6. If scraping fails with default fetcher, automatically retry with stealth\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn the extracted data in a clean, readable format. For tables, use markdown tables. For lists, use bullet points. Include the page title and URL.",
